  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am Aobakwe Keeme, a dedicated student from Klerksdorp, South Africa. My journey into the world 
    of computers began in high school, where I excelled in Computer Application Technology. HTML fascinated 
    me, and I created my own basic website. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Sciences and Statistics 
    at Walter Sisulu University.
  </p>

  <p>As I weigh my options, I am considering specializing in either software engineering, data science, or software 
    development. Each path offers unique challenges and opportunities:
    <ol>
      <li>Software Engineering: Crafting elegant and efficient code appeals to me. I envision myself building robust 
        applications and solving complex problems. Whether it is web development, mobile apps, or backend systems, I 
        am eager to lean and contribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Science: The allure of data-driven insights and predictive modeling intrigues me. I would love to dive deep 
        into data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. Unraveling patterns from data sets excites me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software Development: Creating user-friendly software that impacts people's lives excites me. Whether it is designing 
        intuitive interfaces, optimizing algorithms, or ensuring smooth functionality, I want to be part of the development process.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>Learning and feedback are essential to my growth. I embrace criticism as an opportunity for improvement. Problem-solving fuels my
    passion â€” I aim to thrive on debugging code, optimizing algorithms, and finding elegant solutions.
